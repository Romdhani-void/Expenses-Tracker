Build a personal Expense Tracker app using microservices architecture.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Authentication: Email/password signup + Google OAuth login
- Session-based protection with JWT
- Multi-currency support (HUF, CAD, etc.)
- Monthly budget planning with customizable categories

MICROSERVICES:

1. Auth Service (Node.js/Express + Postgres)
   - User registration and login
   - Google OAuth integration
   - JWT token generation and validation
   - Session management

2. Budget Service (Node.js/Express + Postgres)
   - Create monthly budgets with categories
   - Set spending limits per category
   - Track opening/closing balance month-to-month
   - Support multiple currencies

3. Transaction Service (Python/Flask + MongoDB)
   - Add income (salary, extra income)
   - Add expenses by category with date, amount, currency, notes
   - Edit/delete transactions
   - Filter by date range and category

4. Analytics Service (Python/Flask + Redis cache)
   - Calculate total expenses per month
   - Compute closing balance (opening + income - expenses)
   - Separate "real available" vs "saves"
   - Monthly comparison and trends
   - Budget vs actual spending

5. API Gateway (Nginx/Kong)
   - Single entry point for frontend
   - Route requests to appropriate services
   - Auth middleware

FRONTEND (React):
- Dashboard with month selector
- Summary cards: opening balance, salary, extra income, total expenses, closing balance, saves
- Editable category table with planned vs actual values
- Add transaction modal
- Monthly trend visualization
- Responsive design

KEY FEATURES:
- Recurring category auto-fill (e.g., rent always 127 HUF)
- Currency conversion tracking
- Real available money calculation (closing balance - designated saves)
- Monthly carryover of closing → opening balance

TECH STACK:
- Auth Service: Node.js, Express, Postgres, Passport.js
- Budget Service: Node.js, Express, Postgres
- Transaction Service: Python, Flask, MongoDB
- Analytics Service: Python, Flask, Redis
- API Gateway: Nginx or Kong
- Frontend: React, Axios
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for async communication between services

OUTPUT:
- Complete project structure with folders per service
- API documentation for each service
- Database schemas
- Environment variable templates
- README with setup instructions

Keep business logic simple—focus on clean microservices separation.
